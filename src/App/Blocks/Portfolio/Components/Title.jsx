        I created STATAMIC, co-host FULL STACK RADIO, and am working on RADICAL
        DESIGN COURSE. I was homeschooled, live in Florida, wash dishes, shower
        often, learn quickly, strive to put others first, and live my life for
        Jesus. I'm a dad, husband, and a kid at heart. I wish I could
        skateboard.
